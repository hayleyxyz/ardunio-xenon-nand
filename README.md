# Xbox 360 NAND dumper/flasher for Ardunio

After flashing a borked NAND, I needed a way to fix my test kit. This code is mostly adapted from https://github.com/Free60Project/tools/tree/master/picflash and https://github.com/Free60Project/libxenon/tree/master/libxenon/drivers/xenon_nand to work on an Ardunio Uno. I plan to support Ardunio Micro and Raspberry Pi.

This is a WIP.
